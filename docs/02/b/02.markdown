Comments
--------

### Single line comments

Single line comments are added to an arbitrary tree as follows:

```scala
tree withComment("comments here", ...)
```

For example,

```console:new
scala> import treehugger.forest._, definitions._, treehuggerDSL._
scala> val tree = LIT(2) withComment("comments are useful",
  "only if they provide more info than the code")
scala> treeToString(tree)
```

### Scaladoc style comments

Scaladoc style comments are written using `withDoc` as follows:

```scala
tree withDoc("comments" | doctag, ...)
```

where `doctag` is a doctag defined as `DocTag.See(IntClass)`, `DocTag.Author("Somebody")`, etc.

For example,

```console
scala> val tree2 = (DEF("x") := LIT(0)) withDoc(
  "does something",
  DocTag.See(IntClass))
scala> treeToString(tree2)
```
