Comments
--------

Single line comments are added to an arbitrary tree as follows:

```scala
tree withComment("comments here", ...)
```

In the above, `...` indicates that the method takes a vararg.

For example,

```scala
LIT(2) withComment("comments are useful",
  "only if they provide more info than the code")
```

print as

```scala
// comments are useful
// only if they provide more info than the code
2
```
