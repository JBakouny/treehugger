Variables
---------

### Abstract variable declarations

Abstract variable declarations are written using `VAR(...)`:

```scala
(VAR("foo", IntClass): Tree)
```

or in general:

```scala
VAR(sym|"x", typ|"C").tree
```

### Variable definitions

Value definitions are written as:

```scala
VAR("foo", IntClass) := LIT(0)
```

as a special form of initializing the variable with the default value of the type, `WILDCARD` can be used as follows:

```scala
VAR("foo", IntClass) := WILDCARD
```

This prints as:

```scala
var foo: Int = _
```
