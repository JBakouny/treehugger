Basic Declarations and Definitions
----------------------------------

A _definition_, such as a function defnition, introduces names that are bound to some expression, block, or a type.

```scala
def foo: Int = 1
```

On the other hand, an abstract _declaration_ introduces only the names and their types. It can be a part of an abstract class definition.

```scala
def foo: Int
```
