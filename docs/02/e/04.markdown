Tuples and Parentheses
----------------------

There are three ways to write tuple expressions. The most general form is `TUPLE(tree, ...)`:

```scala
TUPLE()                      // ()
TUPLE(REF("x"))              // (x)
TUPLE(LIT(0), LIT(1))        // (0, 1)
```

The second way is to use `UNIT` literal:

```scala
UNIT                         // ()
```

Finally, `PAREN(tree, ...)` can also be used to write a tuple expression:

```scala
PAREN(REF("x"))              // (x)
```

Semantically speaking the actual `scala.Tuple`_n_ are formed only when two or more arguments are passed, but as a syntactic expression, `PAREN` is just an alias to `TUPLE`.
