Anonymous Functions
-------------------

Anonymous functions are written using `LDAMBDA(VAL(...), ...) ===> rhs`:

```scala
LAMBDA(VAL("x")) ==> (REF("x") INT_+ LIT(1))

LAMBDA(VAL("x", IntClass)) ==> BLOCK(
  REF("x") INT_+ LIT(1))
```

These examples print as:

```scala
x => x + 1

{ (x: Int) =>
  x + 1
}
```

As the second example shows, when the right-hand side tree is a block, the entire anonymous function is wrapped in a block, which makes it convenient to be used with higher-order functions.

### Wildcard parameter

The parameter list of anonymous functions may be `WILDCARD`:

```scala
LAMBDA(VAL(WILDCARD)) ==> (REF("x") INT_+ LIT(1))
```

This prints as:

```scala
_ => x + 1
```

### Placeholder syntax

In addition, an anonymous functions are formed when an expression contains `WILDCARD`.

```scala
WILDCARD INT_+ WILDCARD      // _ + _
```
