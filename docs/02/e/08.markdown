Types, Annotations, and Assignments
-----------------------------------

### Typed Expressions

Typed expressions are written using `withType(typ|"C")`:

```scala
LIT(0) withType(LongClass)   // (0: Long)
```

### Annotated Expressions

Annotated expressions are written using `withAnnots(annot, ...)`:

```scala
REF("e") withAnnots(ANNOT(UncheckedClass))
```

This prints as:

```scala
(e: @unchecked)
```

Annotations are covered later in details.

### Assignments

Assignments are written using `:=`:

```scala
REF("x") := LIT(0)           // x = 0 
```
