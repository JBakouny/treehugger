## bug fixes and minor enhancements

- Adds `DEFTHIS withParams(...) := tree`. See [Classes][1] for more details. [#17][17] reported by [@wheaties][@wheaties]
- Adds `INFIX_CHAIN(sym|"op", tree, ...)`.

`INFIX_CHAIN` allows chaining of infix operations:

    INFIX_CHAIN(Any_==, LIT(1) :: LIT(2) :: LIT(3) :: Nil)

This prints as:

    1 == 2 == 3
