## Function type contructors

Several ways were added to create function types.

    typ1 TYPE_=> typ2
    TYPE_FUNCTION(typ, ..., r)
    TYPE_FUNCTION(typ :: Nil, r)

## Now accepting Iterables

DSL was expanded to accept `Iterable[A]` where it accepted vararg of `A`. Also implicit conversions were expanded to handle iterables. These changes should minimize explicit conversions that were necessary in the previous version:

    withTypeParams(sym.pipeParams map {TYPEVAR(_)})

## Bug fixes and minor enhancements

- Fixes param modifiers not printing. [#1][1]
- Fixes passing args to parent constructors. [#2][2]
- Adds `withParams(...)` to `DEF(sym)`. [#3][3]
